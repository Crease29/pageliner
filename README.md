## Features

### Add guidelines from the rulers

Hover over one of the rulers and start dragging a new guideline from there, like you know it from Photoshop.

### Add guidelines with shortcuts

- <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>H</kbd> adds a *horizontal* guideline at your cursor position and selects it for keyboard movement.
- <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd> adds a *vertical* guideline at your cursor position and selects it for keyboard movement.
- <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> adds a *horizontal* and a *vertical* guideline at your cursor position.

### Move guidelines with keyboard

1. Add a guideline.
2. Click on it (the guideline will slightly blur then).
3. Use your arrow keys to move the guideline.

:fire: **PRO TIP**: Hold down <kbd>Shift</kbd> while using the arrow keys to move the guideline faster. :wink:

### Remove guidelines with keyboard

1. Select a guideline.
2. Press <kbd>Del</kbd>.

### Discard active guideline selection

1. Select a guideline.
2. Press <kbd>Esc</kbd>.

### Measure the distance between guidelines / window border

1. Hover over a guideline.
2. Hold down <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>.

### Show and hide guidelines and rulers with shortcuts
- <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>G</kbd> toggles the visibility of the guidelines.
- <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd> toggles the visibility of the rulers.
